<Note>
Before you get started, make sure you have [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installed, as our toolkit depends on it.
</Note>

## Quickstart

<Steps>

  <Step title="Initialize your app">
Once you have Foundry installed, set up your new app using `create-patchwork`.

<CodeGroup>

```bash pnpm
pnpm create patchwork
```
```bash npm
npx create-patchwork
```

</CodeGroup>

This will scaffold a new starter project with all the services you'll need to get started, including a React frontend, a Ponder indexer with built-in tRPC server, and Docker configurations for orchestrating the above and working with Anvil.


  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your Patchwork config">
    In the root directory of your newly created project, you'll find a `patchwork.config.ts` file. This is where you'll configure your app's contracts and settings.
    <Card href="/pdk/configs">**Learn more about `patchwork.config.ts`**</Card>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Spin up test environment">
    If you have Docker installed and running, you can spin up your app's test environment with a single command:

    ```bash
    pdk localDev up
    ```

    This will run all relevant code generators, start your app's services, and deploy your contracts to Anvil. Once it's done, you'll be able to access your app at `http://localhost:3000`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Manual installation

We don't recommend setting up your project manually at this time, as our tooling depends on a specific project structure. We're working on ways to make things more flexible, but for now we recommened sticking with `create-patchwork`.
