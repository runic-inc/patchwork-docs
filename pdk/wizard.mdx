# Wizard

Instead of building your configuration by hand, you can use our visual editor at [wizard.patchwork.dev](https://wizard.patchwork.dev).

## Text-to-Config

Our wizard features a text-to-config tool. Describe the app you’d like to create, and the tool uses AI to generate a configuration for you. To activate, click **Use AI to configure**.

## Exporting Your Config

Once you’re satisfied with your project configuration, click **Export project** to download the config file. Then, run the following command to create your project with the exported configuration:

```bash
pnpm create patchwork newconfig.config.ts
